started with c , in august 2024 , here's a quick recap of the basic programming and stuff
  i learned about overview of computer hardware , like ram ,rom ,kernal , os , almost negleible amount, then came standard c language 
preprocessor directives , functions , arguments , parameter's  ,data types , truncation , short circuiting in OR condition , operators , associativity and precedence , 
basic functions , like printf and scanf , arrays , structure's , pointer's, file handling , still dont remember the syntax
made very few basic programs , like adding of numbers , swapping of number's , pattern printing , storing in array's , string arrays are worst , char* arr[n] , still dont understand them 
and with the end-sem exam's it's all over for c , i belioeve i have a general idea about programming and the logic behind it
