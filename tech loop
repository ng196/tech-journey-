i think i need to think about all the thing's that i have done or tried to do while i have free time to do somethig , i think i am currently in a very confused position 
about what to do next , there is so much things that i can learn or invest my time in , some options that i like are : 
investing time learning a programming language deeply , like javascript , python , java , c++ , there are many options (language)
try to learn by making some projects along with a youtube project tutorial , using completely unknown tools (unknown-projects)
learning the math's and computer science concept's that will be required in ai-ml and data-science (math)
start to do more experiment's with existing AI and how they work , starting with LLM's , atleast try to do something other than just being a consumer (ai)

i know they are completely diffrent thing's or maybe connected , they have to be  , and it's like i am trying to build an app after just learning how to print hello wordld
but i am enjoying it , atleast the felling of learning something new everyday or in a period of time , currently my thinking process about all this is like : 

i do have a fomo about all this , about not learning emerging technologies , and not learning enough about diffrent fields . for me all this about trying to learn 
everyting about all this (tech) , or at the very least have a basic idea of every tool available is based on the thought that <tech> is the new computer , like how 
computer's were when they cane out , and started to become a part of everthing , <tech> should be like this , it's just a possibility but if it came true then i atleast 
have to have some basic knowledge about operating a computer , write an email , store my data into files and try to edit those files, if i can and also to 
earn money

i would like to expllain my <tech>  knowledge here , all about what i learned and how i would like to proceed from now , this is for future reference , and will
be recorded here as either a [first step] or a [remnant] of my tech journey .

for me <tech> is about developing thing's  , it could be a code , an app , a webPage ,or anything that is accesible through my hardware , i am only considering 
software side of things , i would like to get a idea about how hardware works , and how do they interact with diffrent softwares , but that will be too much to focus into 
i realized all thing'a do work by code written by someone , and it's really magical , how using basic 0 and 1 , and their infinite possibilitie's we can make anything
write a program that uses a written program , that use's another program , and finally that uses the hardware transistor's to light diffrent lightbulbs 
now i do have a grasp of how difficult it would have benn to make a gpu to run a AAA game at high fps , and how everything is just a series of moment's drawn on a canvas 
very basic but really cool thing 

i do know that everything is going to be connected in the future via <ai> or some oher daily life things build around ai , will Ai be the new computer ot <tech> i dont know
neither i want to think about it , i do know they need an effiecient hardware , data management and filtering , a lot of power , an interface to use : a command or 
a request , lot of networking , pattern recognition , and fast-filtered data input's   , that will basically cover every single roadmap , and i am trying to 
learn the learning after coding , the main deveopement or creative process 
i do want to create an ai model , for that i will :
  first experiment with local model's ,like llama , flux , eleven labs 
  try to fine tune them , i think something called lora is used for this 
  connect diffrent local model's seamlessly , to create a virtual identity (vi)
  try to do the same by online models , at that time ,there will be ai agents 
  (it's the final project , and has a very high chance of failure , but i will try it once atleasy )

to make <vi> happen , i have to learn about <ai> deeply , how do they work? , i know they are trained on data with text embedding and uses probabilities to access 
next process or next output 

python is very popular and is used in many data related tasks , so i will learn it , soome basic packages , some specific packages , and now do deal with data 
javaScript is very popular and is used to develop webpages , and the logic behind it 
nodeJs is useful to make backend side of thing's , uses javascript
React is also useful in making webpage that dosent require to reload , what's it called ? . snu or something ?
vite is used in something i dont know what , maybe connecting backend to frontend ? , but
external ui's like chakra-ui , help to reduce coding process , as for database's , there's sql and mongodb , i dont know how sql work's
but i have an idea about how mongoDB works , with a connection string ,and collectios of data 

object oriented programming is just another thing after c programming , there you actually develope something without worrying about how that thing is done , for me 
it's like building a house but not from scratch like construction but just the interior designig and decoration's , dont need to worry about how do they stand their
neither inside fitting , you being some external package you use them 

game engibes are another kind of <tech> , i didn't have the chance to try them out and develop even a mario game , but i think they work like making something with 
lego piece's and fine tunig them , using small lego piece's 

and that's all , i though i learned a lot but now that i see it , it's just very small , not even a useful code could be written with this , i hope to find something
that will help me get out from this <tech loop>
